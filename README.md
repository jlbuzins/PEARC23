The study of stratified and turbulent shear flows is of great societal
interest. In addition to its visually striking nature, such flows are
ubiquitous and understanding them is vital for understanding a number of
phenomena, including but not limited to, improved comprehension of heat
transfer in the oceans and atmosphere. Such knowledge is typically obtained
through costly and careful observation of the natural environment. However,
careful experiments can accurately model facets of the environment within a
laboratory, allowing for the rapid generation of high-quality data and insight
into the governing physics. One such recent experiment is the stratified
inclined duct (SID) [1–9]. A study is underway to leverage the work of the SID
to address some of the costs of a lab, that is, reliable and real-time
annotation of experimental data, with the fundamental goal of developing an
algorithm to predict mixing events and turbulence in generic stratified
experiments. To do so, HPC resources are utilized to analyze 349 GB of shared
SID shadowgraph data. The initial and highly visual stages of this work are the
subject of this visualization. This process is representative of other academic
research projects that are enabled by modern HPC environments.
